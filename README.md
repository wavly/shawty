# Shawty

**Shawty** is a URL shortener built using [Golang](https://go.dev),
[Turso](https://turso.tech) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org). It provides a simple
web interface for shortening URLs, tracking their usage, and offering
statistics about shortened URLs.

## Features
- **Web UI with Golang's** `html/template`:
A minimalistic web interface built using [Golang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))'s standard `html/template`
package and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

- **URL Click Statistics**:
Keep track of how many times each shortened URL is accessed.

- **Input Validation**:
Checks if the URL is a valid URL schema. It only allows `https://` URLs. And
also checks if the URL contains a valid
[TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain).
